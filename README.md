Personal Project: Cyber Blog Website
By Calvin Yorn

Why:
I wanted to create a website to track my progress as I learn different concepts and tools in Cybersecurity. It serves as both a personal journal of growth and a portfolio to showcase my hands-on projects. By documenting what Iâ€™m learning, I can reinforce my understanding, share knowledge with others, and demonstrate continuous progress in my cybersecurity journey.

Tools:
JavaScript, HTML/CSS
